    "Many people start testing their luck by playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. In this project, we'll contribute to the development of a mobile app by a medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions. The app will help gambling addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The medical institute needs our help in creating the logical core of the app and to calculate probabilities. \n",

    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
