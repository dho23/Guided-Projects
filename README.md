# Projects

Hello! I'm Darren Ho and I am a recent graduate of Statistics from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo.  The education and coursework at Cal Poly have been stimulating -- growing my passion for data and data driven decision making, and has formed an eagerness to translate my classroom learnings to real-world experience. The projects below were curated by the team at [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/), and were designed to simulate working with real data in real-world scenarios while also helping me learn and apply new data science skills.

### ðŸ“± [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store & Google Play Markets](https://nbviewer.org/github/dho23/Guided-Projects/blob/main/Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20%26%20Google%20Play%20Markets/Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20%26%20Google%20Play%20Markets%20%28Guided%20Project%29.ipynb) - 
Acted as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS apps. Goal of this project was to analyze data from the Google Play Store and App Store to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users - the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better!

### [Exploring Hacker News Posts](https://nbviewer.org/github/dho23/Guided-Projects/blob/main/Exploring%20Hacker%20News%20Posts/Exploring%20Hacker%20News%20Posts.ipynb) - 
In this project, I worked with a dataset of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News. For this project, I was interested in posts with titles that began with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`, and wanted to compare the two types of posts to determine the following: 
  - On average, do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` posts receive more comments?
  - On average, do posts created at a certain time receive more comments?

### ðŸš™ [Exploring eBay Car Sales Data](https://nbviewer.org/github/dho23/Guided-Projects/blob/main/Exploring%20eBay%20Car%20Sales%20Data/Exploring%20eBay%20Car%20Sales%20Data.ipynb) - 
In this project, I worked with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classified section of the German eBay website. The aim of this specific project was to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.

### [Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94](https://nbviewer.org/github/dho23/Guided-Projects/blob/main/Finding%20Heavy%20Traffic%20Indicators%20on%20I-94/Finding%20Heavy%20Traffic%20Indicators%20on%20I-94.ipynb) -
In this project, I analyzed a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway. John Hogue made the dataset available, and can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this analysis was to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on the I-94. Such variables can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. Also created data visualizations to give a better idea of what the results tell us. 
  
  

### ðŸ’° [Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates](https://nbviewer.org/github/dho23/Guided-Projects/blob/main/Storytelling%20Data%20Visualization%20on%20Exchange%20Rates/Storytelling%20Data%20Visualization%20on%20Exchange%20Rates.ipynb) -
This project was based on Euro daily exchange rates, and the dataset covered the rates from 1999 to 2021. The data source was from the European Central Bank. This project was about applying what I learned up to this point, which includes exploring and cleaning the dataset, brainstorming an idea for storytelling data visualizations, and then coding it.

### [Employee Exit Surveys](https://nbviewer.org/github/dho23/Portfolio/blob/main/Clean%20%26%20Analyze%20Employee%20Exit%20Surveys/Clean%20and%20Analyze%20Employee%20Exit%20Surveys.ipynb) -
 
In this project, I worked with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. I played the role of a data analyst to help answer the questions our "stakeholders" wanted to know. I experienced that in order to extract any meaningful insights from our data, I had to perform many data cleaning tasks.

### [Star Wars Survey](https://nbviewer.org/github/dho23/Portfolio/blob/main/Star%20Wars%20Survey/Star%20Wars%20Survey.ipynb) - 
In this project, I worked with data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) in order to answer some questions about Star wars (data was collected prior to the 7th installment in the Star Wars Universe). In particular, I wondered: does the rest of America realize that "The Empire Strikes Back" is clearly the best film of the Star Wars franchise? The project included data cleaning, exploratory analysis and some data visualizations to go along with.

### ðŸ’»[Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In](https://nbviewer.org/github/dho23/Portfolio/blob/main/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In.ipynb) - 

In this project, I acted as if I were working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement. Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in.

 ### [Mobile App for Lottery Addiction](https://nbviewer.org/github/dho23/Portfolio/blob/main/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In.ipynb) - 
  
In this project, I contributed to the development of a fake mobile app by a medican institute that aimed to prevent and treat gambling addictions. The app would help gambling addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The team needed help in creating the logical core of the app and to calculate probabilities. The main purpose of this project was to practice applying proability and combinatorics (permutations and combinations) concepts in a setting that simulates a real-world scenario.  

  
  
 ### ðŸ“±[Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes](https://nbviewer.org/github/dho23/Portfolio/blob/main/Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20with%20Naive%20Bayes/Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20with%20Naive%20Bayes.ipynb) - 

In this project, I studied the practical side of the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm by building a spam filter for SMS messages/texts. To classify messages as spam or non-spam, I needed the computer to learn how humans classify messages, use human knowledge to estimate probabilities for a new message, and to classify a new message based on the probability values. The goal was to create a spam filter that classifies new messages with high accuracy.
